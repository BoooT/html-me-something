                <p>
                    "I started skateboarding in middle school. I think at the age of 13 is when I first got introduced to the sport and been in love ever since. So, from middle school up until graduation skateboarding was my thing! It was something I really enjoyed as a youth. Learning new tricks and meeting new friends. I always wanted to become pro but that was out of cards for me. Kids these days that are good enough to be pros can't even become pro because of the talent that dominates in the sport."

                    I think it is safe to say that we are all moved by some kind of music. I always wanted to play an instrument and some how I gravitated towards the guitar. My favorite musician is Jimi Hendrix, but I'm not as much of a fan of an electric guitar as I am of the acoustic guitar. I want to learn how to play many songs on the acoustic guitar and I'm currently learning how to play "Hey Joe", which is a song by Jimi Hendrix.

                <h2>I will turn programming will become a career</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently at a point in my life where I'm just a bit confused as what to do next, but what I do know is that I want the ability to work in an enviorment that is constantly changing and need a workforce that is willing to adapt to the changes...And I found it...Programming! I am currently a participant in the launchcode program and it is the change I needed in my life. I'm hoping to become a professional in this field wether that means working for myself by developing apps or working for a large tech company like Microsoft or Apple. This is something that is going to turn into a hobby ultimatley into the best job anyone could've asked for.
